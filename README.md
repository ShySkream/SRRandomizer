# SRRandomizer
Note that this is a **work in progress** and not yet suitable for release.

---
 ## Features
 * Randomize the types of Slimes that spawn with 3 different settings.
 
 ## Planned Features (roughly in order of priority)
 * Randomize crops
 * Randomize gordos
 * Randomize plort market
 * Randomize crates
 * Randomize trades
 * Randomize plort drops
 
 **Note**: I'm not sure how many of these are feasible, these are more or less just ideas
